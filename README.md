### Hi there 👋🦊

I'm Hayley, I'm a red fox who has a facination in electronics and programming!

I believe that in order to make IT sustainable we must build hardware and software which is open, modular and standardised.

#### Stuff I'm currently working on 🔧

- ⌨️ QMK drivers for the Ducky One2SF RGB controller &emsp; [hugglesfox/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/hugglesfox/qmk_firmware/tree/one2sf_rgb)
- ⌚ An accurate and programmable watch &emsp; [hugglesfox/watch](https://github.com/hugglesfox/watch)
